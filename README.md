# Data-Analysis Projects

The folders in this repository correspond with different dataset analyses. They each contain a README file explaining the dataset, steps used to manipulate the dataset, and key information attained.

Most manipulations are done with Python in a Jupyter Notebook, which contains markdown explanations for further clarity.

More folders will be added to this repository as I learn and experiment with different tools and languages.
