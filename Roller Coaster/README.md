# Rollercoaster EDA

### Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis on a Kaggle dataset

This dataset includes information on rollercoaster rides across the country. It contains features such as height, speed, and location.

The goal of this project was to:

1. Understand the data at a high level
2. Prepare the data for analysis <br>
   Create a subset of the data <br>
   Change the data types of some fields<br>
   Rename columns<br>
   Count NULL values<br>
   Count duplicated values
3. Feature Understanding
   Plot data univariate analysis
   Understand data distribution
4. Feature Relationships/Correlations <br>
   Scatterplots
   Heatmaps
5. Asking questions <br>
   What are the locations that have the fastest roller coasters? (Locations must have at least 10 roller coasters
   )

### Key Takeaways:

Most rollercoasters were made in 1999 <br>
There's a high, positive correlation (73%) between the height and speed of a rollercoaster <br>
The oldest rollercoaster in this dataset was introduced in 1884, but the average year of introduction is 1995. The Interquartile range of the years is 1989 to 2010.
