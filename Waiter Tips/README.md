# Waiter Tips EDA

### Data Exploration and Machine Learning (Linear Regression)

##### Dataset: Waiter Tips

This dataset includes information on restaurant tables and the tips they left. It includes such information as the bill amount, how many people were in the party, and the sex of the waiter/waitress.

The goal of this project was to:

1. Understand the data at a high level with visualizations
2. Prepare the data for machine learning training <br>
   - Turn Categorical attributes into Numerical Features
3. Asking questions <br>
   What is the expected tip given based on several variables:<br>
   -The total bill (plus tax)
   -Sex of the bill payer
   -The day of the week
   -How many people were in the party
   -If the bill payer smoked
   -Type of meal (lunch/dinner)

### Key Takeaways:

Taking in several factors, Machine Learning can quickly predict how of a tip can be expected
